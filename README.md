# Market-Basket-Analysis-with-Apriori-Algorithm
Implementation of Market Basket Analysis (MBA) with Apriori Algorithm has been done to identify the relationships between two or more items. Calculation of key metrics such as support, confidnece and lift are also calculated. Association rules are also defined. 
# Procedure
Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset -> Understood the basic details of the dataset -> Data Preprocessing (Removed null values & Single order transactions) -> Trained the model with Apriori Algorithm with 60% of the data -> Defined Association rules -> Calculated Support, Confidence and Lift values -> Displayed the relevant relationships between products
